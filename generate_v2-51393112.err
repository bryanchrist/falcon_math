/home/brc4cb/.conda/envs/falcon_40B/lib/python3.9/site-packages/bitsandbytes/cuda_setup/main.py:149: UserWarning: Found duplicate ['libcudart.so', 'libcudart.so.11.0', 'libcudart.so.12.0'] files: {PosixPath('/home/brc4cb/.conda/envs/falcon_40B/lib/libcudart.so.11.0'), PosixPath('/home/brc4cb/.conda/envs/falcon_40B/lib/libcudart.so')}.. We'll flip a coin and try one of these, in order to fail forward.
Either way, this might cause trouble in the future:
If you get `CUDA error: invalid device function` errors, the above might be the cause and the solution is to make sure only one ['libcudart.so', 'libcudart.so.11.0', 'libcudart.so.12.0'] in the paths that we search based on your env.
